# Machine-Learning-and-the-Hubbard-model
Here is some code and pdf report on applying machine learning to density functional theory and the Hubbard model.

# HubbardClass.py
This python script can be downloaded and used as a template for generating the Hamiltonian matrix for the Hubbard model with specified parameters. It will work in 1D and 2D though if one wishes the extension to 3D should be easy to do by extending the 2D methods within.
